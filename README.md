This repository consists of my logic circuit verilog course.

There is a LogicLabManual which consists of labs projects

1. ### Lab 4 :

   - [ ] Parity bit circuit
   - [ ] Xnor gate
   - [ ] sop/pos circuit

2. ### Lab 5 :

   - [ ] Priority encoder
   - [ ] Decoder
   - [ ] Multiplexer

3. ### Lab 6 :

   - [ ] Comparator Bit

4. ### Lab 7 :

   - [ ] Half Adder
   - [ ] Full Adder

5. ### Lab 8 :

   - [ ] Arithmetic-Logic-Unit

6. ### Lab 9 :

   - [ ] FF with ActiveLow Clock

7. ### Lab 10 :

   - [ ] State machine 

   - [ ] Register

     ------

     The <u>final Project</u> is about creating a smart Home which contains of 7 part.

     - ### Temperature Sensor
